Overview
  You will design a simple CMS backend for a fictional video game, movie, or music review site.  [I will use a "Game CMS" as the example within specifications, but you can choose the media of your choice.] The CMS will have multiple user access levels and allow for inserting, deleting, and displaying reviews.
